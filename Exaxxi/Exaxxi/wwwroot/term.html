    <h1>Terms and Conditions </h1>
    Last Updated: October 9, 2018
    StockX LLC (“StockX,” “we,” “us”, or “our”) operates a live marketplace that allows users to research, buy and sell certain consumer goods. These Terms and Conditions of Use, our Privacy Policy (the “Privacy Policy”), our Marketplace FAQs (the “FAQS”), and all policies and requirements posted on our websites, all of which are incorporated into these Terms and Conditions of Use by reference and as amended from time to time (collectively, “Terms”) describe the terms and conditions on which we provide our websites (the “Sites”), services, data, software, applications (including mobile applications) and tools (collectively “Services”) to you, whether as a guest or a registered user.

    In these Terms, “you” and “your” refer to (a) you, the individual accessing and/or using the Services, (b) any electronic agent accessing the Sites and/or using the Services on behalf of an individual or business entity, and (c) the business entity on whose behalf an individual or electronic agent is accessing the Sites and/or using the Services.
    These Terms create a legal contract between you and us. Please read them carefully. We will collect and process personal data in accordance with the Privacy Policy. By using the Services you acknowledge that you have read the Privacy Policy.

    By using our Services, or by clicking to accept or agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy when this option is made available to you upon registration, you accept and agree to be bound and abide by these Terms in full. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use any portion of the Services.
    These Terms contain provisions that govern how claims between you and us are resolved (see Section 14, Disputes with StockX below). This includes an obligation to arbitrate certain claims through binding and final arbitration, unless you opt out of the arbitration when you sign up with us. Unless you opt out, you will only be permitted to bring claims against us and seek relief on an individual basis, not as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative action or proceeding, and you will only be permitted to seek relief (including monetary, injunctive, and declaratory relief) on an individual basis.

    1. Changes to Terms and Policies.
    StockX may in our discretion change these Terms (including the Privacy Policy and the FAQs or any policy) without notice to you. Changes take effect when we post them on our Sites. You should view these Terms often to stay informed of any changes that may affect you. YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SITE AND/OR SERVICES AFTER WE CHANGE THESE TERMS CONSTITUTES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE CHANGES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ANY OF THE CHANGES, YOU MUST CANCEL YOUR ACCOUNT AND NOT USE ANY PORTION OF THE SERVICES.
    The version of these Terms posted on our Sites on each respective date you visit the Sites will be the Terms applicable to your access and use of the Services on that date. Our electronically or otherwise properly stored copies of these Terms and the Privacy Policy shall be deemed to be the true, complete, valid, and authentic copies of the version of the Terms and the Privacy Policy that were in force on each respective date you visited the Sites. We reserve the right to terminate these Terms, or to refuse, restrict, or discontinue access to or use of the Services (or any portions, components, or features thereof) to you or any other person or entity, if you are in breach of the Terms or for any reason or for no reason whatsoever, at any time, without notice or liability.

    2. About StockX Live Marketplace.
    StockX provides a live marketplace for buyers and sellers of certain consumer products. A description of the live marketplace process and the rules applicable to buyers and sellers is available on our FAQ page, as updated from time to time. Although the Services include buy and sell functionality: (1) StockX facilitates the purchase transaction, but the actual purchase contract is directly between the buyer and seller; (2) although StockX might provide historical pricing data, we do not set prices for the items; and (3) StockX is not an auctioneer. StockX acts as a commercial agent to conclude the sale on behalf of each buyer and seller involved in each transaction. Because sellers set prices, they may be higher than retail value. Any item valuations displayed through the Services are estimates only. StockX does not guarantee that any item will sell. We reserve the right to investigate complaints and violations of these Terms and, to the extent permitted by applicable law, may take any actions we deem appropriate, including suspending your account and charging your credit card for costs we incur as a result of the violation. Although the Services are anonymous and we generally do not share your information with other buyers and sellers, we may share your information with law enforcement and other third parties as part of an investigation related to any alleged violation of law or these Terms, and we may respond to all inquiries initiated by law enforcement or other governmental agencies.
    The Services are accessible to certain international sellers and buyers. StockX may provide access to certain features and tools to international sellers and buyers, such as estimated local currency conversion and integrated international shipping, customs and tax tools. Sellers and buyers are responsible for complying with all laws and regulations applicable to the international sale, purchase, and shipment of items.

    3. Accounts, Passwords, and Security.
    To view or browse the live marketplace, you must create an account using an email address and password or other account creation tools offered on the Services, such as a social media account. To offer items for sale (“Ask”) or offer to purchase items (“Bid”), you must create an account and have a valid credit card or other approved payment method on file with us. You agree that we may charge your credit card or other payment method for amounts you owe as described in these terms, as well as any costs or losses arising from your violation of the Terms. When you register to create an account with us, you agree to provide accurate information about yourself and must not register under a false name or age or use an unauthorized payment method. If you use any Service, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password and for restricting access to your computer, and you agree to accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account or password. You agree to notify StockX immediately upon learning of any unauthorized use of your account or password, or any other unauthorized access or breach of security. However, you may be held liable for losses incurred by StockX or any other person or entity due to another person using your account or password. You may not use any other user’s account or password at any time without the express permission and consent of the holder of that account or password. You may not transfer or assign your account.
    Please review our other policies posted on this site which are part of the Terms and govern your use of the Services. We reserve the right to make changes to our site, policies, and the Terms at any time.
    StockX cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with these obligations. If you are under 18, you may use the Services only with involvement of a parent or guardian.
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account in the event that you breach any of these Terms.

    4. Fees, Promotional/Discount Codes and Taxes.
    Fees for the Services, including applicable shipping fees, are described in our FAQ , as updated from time to time. StockX may sometimes furnish an alphanumeric code that can be used for promotions or discounts for purchases on our sites. These promotional or discount codes may be sent via email to our registered users, presented on our web sites or circulated at events and through other means and, unless otherwise provided are subject to the promotional or discount terms available here Discount Policy. As a seller you are responsible and agree to collect, pay, report and remit any and all local, state, provincial, federal, or international taxes (including VAT and sales tax) that may be due with respect to your sales transaction, and as a buyer you agree to pay any and all local, state, federal, or international taxes (including sales taxes) that may be due with respect to your purchase transaction. You agree that StockX, as the facilitator of the transaction, is not responsible for reporting, collection or payment of any taxes on your behalf. In accordance with the Privacy Policy and if necessary to complete a transaction, you agree to provide StockX with your Social Security Number, Social Insurance Number or other tax ID if necessary for StockX to provide information to the Internal Revenue Service, Canada Revenue Agency or any provincial tax authority related to payments you receive from us and further authorize StockX to release that information to the IRS, CRA, provincial tax authority or other competent governmental body.

    5. Authentication; Shipping and Handling.
    As part of the purchase transaction, the seller will ship the item to StockX and StockX will visually inspect the item and use commercially reasonable efforts to confirm it is authentic. If StockX determines the item is authentic, StockX will ship the item to the buyer. If StockX cannot reasonably confirm the authenticity of the item or determines it is not authentic, then we will notify the buyer and the seller that the item is not authentic and will issue a refund to the buyer. Additionally, StockX has the right to reject any item for any reason, including but not limited to, authenticity or damage of the item. StockX policy requires sellers to ship items within the specified timeframe provided in the sale confirmation email after purchase. However, because StockX cannot control the amount of time it takes for the item to reach StockX, we cannot guarantee a specific delivery timeframe for any items and therefore, buyer is not permitted to cancel the purchase if the item does not ship from the seller within the specified timeframe in the sale confirmation email after purchase. Once we receive the item from the seller it generally takes 1-2 business days for us to authenticate the item and ship it to a buyer. If a buyer does not receive an item, the buyer shall promptly report the issue to StockX within 2 days of the latest estimated delivery date. StockX has the right, in our sole and absolute discretion to refuse to accept returns or other refunds and/or to charge restocking fees for returned or abandoned items.

    6. Counterfeits, Fraud, and Market Manipulation.
    StockX takes counterfeiting, fraud and market manipulation very seriously. If a seller provides a counterfeit item or attempts to defraud any buyer or StockX, StockX reserves the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion: (i) remove any or all of seller’s listings from the Services; (ii) cancel any or all of seller’s orders pending through the Services; (iii) withhold any payments due to seller; (iv) place limits on seller’s buying and selling privileges; (v) charge seller’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by StockX as a result of seller’s action or inaction, including charging seller for the cost of replacement items, the value of coupons and gift certificates provided to the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by StockX, rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and refunds to the buyer; (vi) ship the item back to the seller at the seller’s cost; (vii) provide the counterfeit items to law enforcement or destroy the counterfeit items, (viii) temporarily or permanently suspend seller’s account, and (ix) charge Seller’s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the transaction amount or $15.00 USD for items below $50.00 USD, whichever is greater, as a service fee. Seller hereby agrees that each of the foregoing remedies are reasonable and justified upon StockX’s discovery of counterfeit items or fraudulent actions, even if those items or actions were not known by the Seller at the time to be counterfeit or fraudulent (e.g., negligent fraud). Seller understands and agrees that if we provide the counterfeit item to law enforcement, seller’s communications and any property claim with respect to that item must be solely with that law enforcement agency and not with us. We may also use fraud protection measures, including algorithms and automated systems to monitor for fraud, which might result in cancellation of listings or sales or account suspension. If this occurs in error please contact us at support@stockx.com. We may also require additional identification information from you if you engage in certain high-value transactions or high overall payment volumes through StockX.
    If a buyer receives an item that it believes to be counterfeit, the buyer must notify StockX in writing within 3 days after receiving the item, and we will commence an investigation into the item. The buyer shall cooperate with us in the investigation and final disposition of the item, including providing photographs and other evidence of the item, providing the item to law enforcement, destroying the item, or delivering the item back to us, at our direction. If we elect to have the buyer destroy the item, the buyer shall provide reasonable proof of destruction to us. We will refund all fees and costs paid by the buyer for the item (including shipping and handling). In no event may a buyer resell any item (on StockX or elsewhere) that is reasonably believed to be counterfeit.
    StockX may monitor the integrity of the StockX marketplace and may take steps to protect the marketplace as determined by StockX in its sole discretion (e.g., if StockX believes a seller or buyer is engaging in market manipulation or fraud, including creating false or “dummy” accounts). If StockX believes that a seller or buyer attempts to interfere with the free and fair operation of the StockX marketplace, or creates artificial, false or misleading information, or information appearing to mislead with respect to pricing or demand for a product on the StockX marketplace (all of the foregoing in StockX’s sole discretion), then, without limiting any other rights of StockX, StockX reserves the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion: (i) remove any or all of the user’s listings from the Services; (ii) cancel any or all of the user’s orders pending through the Services; (iii) withhold any payments due to the user; (iv) place limits on a user’s buying and selling privileges; (v) charge user’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by StockX as a result of the user’s actions; (vi) notify law enforcement of the fraudulent activity; (vii) temporarily or permanently suspend the user’s account, and (viii) charge the user’s credit card an additional service fee of up to $1,000 to cover StockX’s investigation fees and other related costs and expenses.

    7. Seller Obligations.
    By listing an item for sale (each posting, a “New Ask”), you are making a binding offer to sell that specific item to a buyer who purchases the item for the Ask price you have specified and to ship the item in accordance with our FAQ as updated from time to time. When a buyer accepts your offer by purchasing your item through our Services, you are contractually and legally bound to deliver that exact item for the specified price. SELLERS MUST SHIP items via the shipping carrier designated by StockX within the specified timeframe provided in the sale confirmation email and must obtain a receipt from the shipping carrier to verify shipment of item. StockX will provide you with a shipping label with such carrier after your Ask is matched by a buyer. You are obligated to monitor your inventory and ensure all listings are accurate. Once a Bid and Ask are matched, under no circumstances may a seller cancel the listing. Failure to fulfill your orders will result in additional charges to you, including an additional charge equal to 15% of the transaction amount or $15.00 USD for items below $50.00 USD, whichever is greater, as a service fee. If a seller fails to deliver items to StockX in accordance with these Terms, StockX reserves the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion: (i) charge seller’s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the transaction amount or $15.00 USD for items below $50.00 USD, whichever is greater, as a service fee; (ii) remove any or all of seller’s listings from the Services; (iii) cancel any or all of seller’s orders pending through the Services; (iv) withhold any payments due to seller; (v) place limits on seller’s buying and selling privileges; (vi) charge seller’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by StockX as a result of seller’s action or inaction, including charging seller for the cost of a replacement, coupons and gift certificates provided to the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by StockX, rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and refunds to the buyer; and (vii) temporarily or permanently suspend seller’s account.
    As a seller, you are required to ensure that the item you are listing exactly matches the image on the New Ask page and meets the applicable Condition Standard. If StockX or a buyer reasonably determines that your item does not conform to the description (including, without limitation, meeting the applicable Condition Standard), or is counterfeit, then we will charge your credit card an amount equal to 15% of the transaction amount or $15.00 USD for items below $50.00 USD, whichever is greater, as a service fee, plus additional amounts or, as determined in StockX’s discretion, charging you for the cost of a replacement, coupons and gift certificates provided to the buyer, reprinting fees incurred by StockX, rerouting charges imposed by carriers, and refunds to the buyer. StockX has no obligation to return items that do not conform to the description (including, without limitation, meeting the applicable Condition Standard), or are counterfeit (in which case, StockX may turn those items over to the proper authorities) at your cost. StockX will pay you within thirty (30) days after the sale is complete, which occurs when the buyer receives the item. To get paid more quickly, ship your items immediately after your Ask is matched by a buyer. To see the fees applicable to sales transactions, please refer to the New Ask window where your Ask price is entered. You will also receive fee information via email notification when an Ask goes live, is updated, or a sale occurs.

    8. Buyer Obligations.
    As a buyer, you are obligated to pay for any items you Bid on when your Bid matches a seller’s Ask. WHEN YOU PLACE A BID, YOU ARE COMMITTING TO PURCHASE THE ITEM AS SOON AS YOUR BID MATCHES A SELLER’S ASK PRICE AND YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT PAYMENT OF THE ASK PRICE WILL BE TAKEN FROM YOUR PAYMENT METHOD. To be an eligible buyer you must have a billing address and shipping address within one of the countries that StockX supports. You can see a full list of these countries at Available Countries, which may be updated from time to time. If your address is outside the United States, then you will be responsible for picking up your package and for paying all customs, duties, taxes and any other related fees in addition to the international shipping charges; you will be solely responsible for compliance with all customs requirements on import; and, when placing your order, you authorize us to appoint an agent to file the customs declarations on your behalf. In general, we charge your credit card immediately upon purchase and hold the funds in escrow until the transaction is complete, at which time we pay the seller. You will not receive any interest on the escrowed amount. You might be required to pay certain fees as described when placing your Buy Order, as updated from time to time. If your payment fails or is rejected for any reason (e.g., purchase exceeds credit card limit, card is cancelled, chargeback is requested), StockX reserves the right to do any or all of the following, in its sole discretion: (i) charge buyer’s credit card an additional amount equal to 15% of the transaction amount or $15.00 USD for items below $50.00 USD, whichever is greater, as a service fee; (ii) remove any or all of buyer’s Bids from the Services; (iii) cancel any or all of buyer’s orders pending through the Services; (iv) withhold refunds or payments due to buyer; (v) place limits on buyer’s buying and selling privileges; (vi) charge buyer’s credit card for costs, expenses and fees incurred by StockX as a result of buyer’s action or inaction; and (vii) temporarily or permanently suspend buyer’s account. ALL SALES ARE FINAL ONCE THE ITEM IS AUTHENTICATED AND DELIVERED, AND NO REFUND REQUESTS WILL BE HONORED REGARDLESS OF THE CURRENT VALUE OF THE ITEM. If you experience a problem with your purchase or an item, please contact us at support@stockx.com. If there is a problem with an item you received, you must contact us in writing within 3 days after receiving the item with a detailed description of the problem. StockX verification tags or stickers that are attached to items must not be removed, or the items will not be eligible for return or exchange under any circumstance (including damage in transit).

    14. Disputes with StockX.
    You and StockX agree that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between us relating in any way to or arising out of the Terms or your use of, or access to, the Services, will be resolved in accordance with the provisions set forth in this Section 14. PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND WILL HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT ON HOW CLAIMS YOU AND STOCKX HAVE AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE RESOLVED.
    You agree that, except to the extent inconsistent with the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) or preempted by federal law, the laws of the State of Michigan, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern these Terms and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and StockX. Legal notices shall be served on StockX’s national registered agent (in the case of StockX) or your email address on file with us (in your case). Notice by us to you shall be deemed given twenty-four (24) hours after the email is sent. Alternatively, we may give you legal notice by mail to the physical address you have on file with us. In such case, notice shall be deemed given three (3) days after the date of mailing, regardless of whether any such notice is returned to us. It is your responsibility to keep your contact information updated.
    You and StockX each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and StockX relating in any way to or arising out of the Terms or your use of or access to the Services, shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court. Alternatively, you may assert your claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify and so long as the matters remains in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis. The FAA governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
    IN ALL EVENTS, EACH PARTY HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARY AND INTENTIONALLY, WAIVES (TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW) ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY DISPUTE ARISING UNDER OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OR YOUR USE OF OR ACCESS TO THE SERVICES. THE PARTIES FURTHER AGREE THAT, IF AND TO THE EXTENT THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATION DOES NOT APPLY TO ANY CLAIM, THAT CLAIM WILL BE TRIED BEFORE A JUDGE SITTING WITHOUT A JURY.
    a. PROHIBITION OF CLASS AND REPRESENTATIVE ACTIONS AND NON-INDIVIDUALIZED RELIEF (THE “CLASS ACTION WAIVER”). YOU AND STOCKX AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND STOCKX AGREE OTHERWISE IN A SEPARATE WRITING, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, CLASS, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER STOCKX USERS. IF A COURT DECIDES THAT APPLICABLE LAW PRECLUDES ENFORCEMENT OF ANY OF THIS PARAGRAPH’S PROHIBITIONS ON CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS OR PROCEEDINGS AS TO ANY CLAIM, THEN THAT CLAIM (AND ONLY THAT CLAIM) MUST BE SEVERED FROM THE ARBITRATION AND RESOLVED IN COURT, SUBJECT TO YOUR AND STOCKX’S RIGHT TO APPEAL THE COURT’S DECISIONS. ALL OTHER CLAIMS WILL BE ARBITRATED.
    b. Arbitration Procedures. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An arbitrator should also apply the Terms as a court would. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the interpretation or enforceability of the CLASS ACTION WAIVER will be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction. Other than issues related to the CLASS ACTION WAIVER, the arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement to Arbitrate, any part of it, or of the Terms including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate or the Terms is void or voidable.
    The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations will not apply. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The use of the word “arbitrator” in this provision shall not be construed to prohibit more than one arbitrator from presiding over an arbitration; rather, the AAA’s rules will govern the number of arbitrators that may preside over an arbitration conducted under the Agreement to Arbitrate.
    A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a completed form Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). A Notice to StockX should be sent to 1046 Woodward Ave., Detroit, MI 48226. StockX will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file associated with your StockX account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. All information called for in the Notice must be provided, including a description of the nature and basis of the claims the party is asserting and the relief sought.
    If you and StockX are unable to resolve the claims described in the Notice within 30 days after the Notice is sent, you or StockX may initiate arbitration proceedings. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s website at www.adr.org. In addition to filing this form with the AAA in accordance with its rules and procedures, the party initiating the arbitration must mail a copy of the completed form to the opposing party. You may send a copy to StockX at the following address: 1046 Woodward Ave., Detroit, MI 48226. In the event StockX initiates arbitration against you, it will send a copy of the completed form to the physical address we have on file associated with your StockX account. Any settlement offer made by you or StockX shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator.
    The arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or StockX may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and StockX subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. In cases where an in-person hearing is held, you and/or StockX may attend by telephone, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of Michigan, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different StockX users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same StockX user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
    c. Costs of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate.
    d. Severability. With the exception of any of the provisions in the CLASS ACTION WAIVER, if an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply.
    e. Opt-Out Procedure. If you are a new user of our Services, you can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate by notifying us in writing that you opt-out (“Opt-Out Notice”). Your Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after the date you accept the Terms for the first time. You must mail your Opt-Out Notice to: StockX LLC, 1046 Woodward Ave., Detroit, MI 48226.
    Your Opt-Out Notice should state that you opt-out of this Agreement to Arbitrate and provide your name, address (including street number and address, city, state, and zip code), phone number and the email address(es) used to log in to the StockX account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign and date the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the Terms will continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.
    f. Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate. Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than a change to any notice address or website link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not apply to any claim that was filed in a legal proceeding between you and StockX prior to the effective date of the change. The amendment shall apply to all other disputes or claims governed by the Agreement to Arbitrate that have arisen or may arise between you and StockX. We will notify you of amendments to this Agreement to Arbitrate by posting the amended terms on http://www.StockX.com at least thirty (30) days before the effective date of the amendments and by sending notice via email to your email address on file with us. If you do not agree to the amended terms, you may close your account within the thirty (30) day period and you will not be bound by the amended terms.
